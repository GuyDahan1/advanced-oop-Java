Advanced OOP Concepts in Java

This repository is a showcase of advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, with a focus on integrating Design Patterns, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), and Multithreading. This project was developed as part of my Advanced Programming course during my first degree.

Features

1. Design Patterns

Implementation of core design patterns such as:

Singleton

Observer

Factory

Strategy

Decorator

Each design pattern is demonstrated with practical examples and explanations.

2. GUI Development

Java Swing and JavaFX are used to create interactive graphical user interfaces.

Includes projects demonstrating:

Event-driven programming

Custom components

Dynamic user interactions

3. Multithreading

Hands-on implementation of multithreading concepts:

Thread creation and management

Synchronization

Thread pools

Real-world multithreaded applications (e.g., concurrent data processing and animations).
